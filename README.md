Video Transcription and Spreadsheet Integration Documentation
==========================

The video transcription and spreadsheet integration code provides a way to transcribe the speech content of a video file and store the transcriptions in a Google Spreadsheet. The code utilizes the Google Cloud Video Intelligence API for speech transcription and the Google Sheets API for interacting with Google Spreadsheets.

Prerequisites
*******************
Before using the code, ensure that you have the following:

Google Cloud Platform Account: You need a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with the Video Intelligence API and Sheets API enabled.

API Credentials: Obtain the API credentials in JSON format for your GCP project. The credentials file should have the necessary permissions to access the Video Intelligence API and Sheets API.

Python Environment: Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

... dodać

Code Overview
--------------------

The code consists of two main functions:

transcribe_video(video_file_path): This function transcribes the speech content of a video file using the Video Intelligence API.

send_to_spreadsheet(transcription_results): This function sends the transcription results to a Google Spreadsheet using the Sheets API.

Configuration
--------------------
Before running the code, you need to provide the necessary configuration:

API Credentials: Set the credentials_file_path variable to the file path of your API credentials JSON file.

Video File: Set the video_file_path variable to the path of the video file you want to transcribe.

Spreadsheet ID: Set the spreadsheet_id variable to the ID of the Google Spreadsheet where you want to store the transcriptions.

Usage
--------------------
To use the code, follow these steps:

Import the required modules and libraries:


Copy code
import os
import pandas as pd
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import base64
import time
Set the necessary configuration variables as described in the "Configuration" section.

Call the transcribe_video(video_file_path) function to transcribe the video file and retrieve the transcription results.

Call the send_to_spreadsheet(transcription_results) function to send the transcription results to the configured Google Spreadsheet.

Example
--------------------
Here's an example of how to use the code:
python
Copy code
# Set the necessary configuration variables
credentials_file_path = "api.json"
video_file_path = "static/wideo.mkv"
spreadsheet_id = "1XedGFXQbfyBUuaS5g4Uwq1V1BDbCzu40VooF4cFjVbI"

# Call the functions
transcription_results = transcribe_video(video_file_path)
send_to_spreadsheet(transcription_results)

Supported video formats
--------------------

The Video Intelligence API supports common video formats, including .MOV, .MPEG4, .MP4, .AVI, and the formats decodable by ffmpeg.

Conclusion
--------------------

The video transcription and spreadsheet integration code provides a convenient way to transcribe the speech content of a video file and store the transcriptions in a Google Spreadsheet. By following the provided documentation, you can easily integrate this functionality into your own projects.
